📌 Title   : Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol

    The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 
    * Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is 
    still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales
     expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump 
    in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV compe
    tition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tes
    la EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarte
    r, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ra
    mp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales
    ) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales
     for over a year now. 
    * Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero 
    starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump ad
    ministration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 5
    0% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actual
    ly had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income
     from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 
    * And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trendi
    ng towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its o
    perating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would
     reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous 
    driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month T
    esla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/ca
    r/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars
     on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less 
    incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is
     the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factu
    ally rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this 
    point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitor
    s are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia.
     Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and
     surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 
    * Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the
     current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most p
    eople that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assu
    ming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still prob
    ably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were a
    pproximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you ass
    ume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share 
    in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global mark
    et share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab
     was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable
     $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would
     give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billi
    on profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per
     share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, 
    in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market shar
    e, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share
    . 
    **Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending 
    towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a
     range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**

    Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.
    Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company in
    to territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.
    The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge,
     whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department o
    f Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year
     a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and 
    related advertising.
    But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by th
    e DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Don
    ald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”
    Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for
     the Nasdaq.
    The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little
     more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with
     Google its prime subsidiary. .
    CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry 
    Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the
     rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through wh
    ile also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.
    The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favora
    ble antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely 
    ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

📌 Title   : Comcast Gets Serious About Subscriber Losses - A Long Fight Looms

📝 Content:
    Comcast Corp. has a problem - the company is losing customers in its most signif
    icant business, providing internet access to nearly 30 million American househol
    ds.
    The Philadelphia-based telecom and media conglomerate has reported record losses
     of broadband subscribers for three straight quarters, more than half a million 
    accounts in total, after pandemic-related federal subsidies for low-income custo
    mers ended and telecom companies like T-Mobile US Inc. got much more aggressive 
    offering consumers alternative options.
    Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts and his team have jumped into acti
    on, bringing in new management at the broadband division, introducing new pricin
    g plans and pushing harder into other products, such as wireless phone service, 
    to complement their internet offerings and cable TV. Still, there’s no immediate
     end in sight to the cancellations.
    “We’re not offering predictions around when they’ll get back to positive adds,’’
     Chief Financial Officer Jason Armstrong said in an interview. “But everything w
    e’re doing now is designed to put us back on a much better trajectory.”
    For years the company founded by Roberts’ father with the purchase of a single p
    ay-TV franchise in Tupelo, Mississippi, was the king of cable. But as consumers 
    have canceled those pricey TV packages in favor of streaming services like Netfl
    ix Inc., Comcast’s video business has shriveled. At 11.8 million, the company’s 
    cable-TV customers amount to fewer than half their peak in 2008. With that busin
    ess shrinking, Comcast no longer has the easy sell of asking a cable customer to
     sign up for internet access too.
    “Pay TV cord-cutting was really the catalyst that started impacting broadband be
    cause you’re no longer in a bundle,” said streaming media consultant Dan Rayburn
    . “And the value was always in the bundle.”
    Comcast got a boost during the pandemic, along with other providers, as consumer
    s realized they couldn’t function without reliable home internet. Short-lived fe
    deral subsidies for internet access also helped Comcast add broadband customers 
    between 2020 and 2022. But the tide began to turn for the company in mid-2023.
    T-Mobile, AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. have been tapping their 
    wireless networks to deliver internet access at prices that attract budget-consc
    ious consumers. The big three telecom carriers added over 900,000 so-called fixe
    d-wireless accounts in the second quarter alone. Comcast and its peers have hist
    orically provided Internet access through a mix of fiber and coaxial cable conne
    ctions, but the three major telecom companies have also been investing in speedy
     fiber-optic lines right to the home.
    The pressure has forced Comcast management to respond on several fronts. The com
    pany has been offering cheaper plans at slower speeds for low-income consumers. 
    In April, Comcast introduced a new internet pricing program for all customers, i
    ncluding a 5-year price guarantee. Plans start at $55 a month, including taxes a
    nd equipment fees. The new pitch is a departure from the strategy of the past, w
    hich typically involved discounting a customer’s first year or two and then appl
    ying a steep increase in monthly charges.
    The company has also stepped up promotion of its wireless phone service. Subscri
    bers to the 5-year internet plan get a free mobile line for one year. Under a lo
    ng-running deal with Verizon and increasing use of its own infrastructure, Comca
    st is able to undercut its competitors with a lower-priced mobile offering, acco
    rding to Armstrong. The company added a record 378,000 wireless lines in the sec
    ond quarter.
    The theory is that internet customers will stick with Comcast, thanks to the pri
    ce guarantee, and ultimately pay for wireless phone service too. Early signs sug
    gest that customers are also choosing faster speeds, and thus more costly intern
    et plans, an encouraging trend, according to Armstrong.
    “Right now the No. 1 product attaching to broadband is wireless,’’ he said. “Tha
    t is the bundle of the future.”
    The company has reorganized management of its connectivity business in the US, p
    romoting Steve Croney to chief operating officer and hiring Jon Gieselman, a for
    mer Apple Inc. and DirecTV executive, as chief growth officer. It’s also taking 
    steps to improve customer service.
    Broadband troubles aside, Comcast has other businesses that it is investing in, 
    including theme parks and business telecom services, and has managed to increase
     revenue every year since 2020. Later in 2025, it will spin off cable-TV network
    s such as MSNBC and USA, cutting a loose a business where subscriber revenue and
     advertising are challenged by the shift to streaming. Comcast has said its grow
    th businesses, including residential broadband, will account for 65% of revenue 
    after that separation is complete.
    While the company works on its broadband problem, sales are forecast to be littl
    e changed this year and rise 3% in 2026. Unless there’s a turnaround, 2025 will 
    go down as the fourth losing year for Comcast shares in the past five - with the
     stock down about 11% year to date, compared with an 10% gain for the S&amp;P 50
    0 Index.
    “This is not a quick fix,” said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics. “
    This is a multiyear technical and cultural shift. And culture is very hard to ch
    ange.”

    Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think Apple is going anywhere. They aren’t going to 
    become the next Cisco or something.
    However, I am starting to get worried.
    Apple is going no where, however, the hype for their products is just dwindling.
    Gen Z kids are definitely addicted to Apple, but let’s be real, they are perfect
    ly fine having a 3-4 year old IPhone and AirPods. 
    While I like the M series chips, that was 5 years ago at this point, and the des
    ktop consumer market isn’t exactly a growing market. 
    The Vision Pro was a complete bust. 
    Apple services is not doing well. Apple TV is burning money. Most of the gen z p
    eople I know use Spotify, not Apple Music. 
    What’s next? A $2,000 foldable phone? There’s a limit to what people will spend 
    on Apple products, and we saw that with the Vision Pro. 
    I don’t think a $2,000 foldable phone will do very well. 
    Apple will remain a trillion dollar company, however, I just don’t see much grow
    th in the future.

    Compared to other companies such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google, it doesn’t seem 
    like Apple’s stock growth has been that great lately. 
    Now, it is widely known that Apple can afford to be slower to the AI game since 
    people will use their devices regardless. But, it still seems like they are doin
    g it very very slowly and not giving it as much urgency as other Big Tech compan
    ies. 
    Nvidia and Microsoft recently overtook Apple as the world’s largest companies by
     market cap. 
    Where does this go next, and will Apple slowly become smaller than even more com
    panies, and will they collapse in the next 50 years or so?

📝 Content:
    In Q2 2025, India became the largest source of smartphones shipped to the United
     States. 
    About 44% of U.S. smartphone imports were assembled in India, while China’s shar
    e fell to roughly 25% and Vietnam’s was around 30%. 
    The shift is driven mainly by Apple moving more iPhone assembly to India, with s
    ome contribution from Samsung and Motorola. 
    Vendors also front-loaded shipments to the U.S. to hedge against possible tariff
    s later in 2025. 
    Despite the supply-chain shift, total U.S. smartphone shipments grew only about 
    1% year over year; Apple’s shipments declined around 11% while Samsung’s rose ab
    out 38%.
